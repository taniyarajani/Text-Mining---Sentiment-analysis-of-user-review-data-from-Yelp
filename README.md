# Text-Mining---Sentiment-analysis-of-user-review-data-from-Yelp-in-R

A sample of the original dataset (over 4 million review by over a million users for 144K businesses) will be used here. More details on the data are available from https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge. Effectiveness of different sentiment ‘dictionaries’ is examined, and developed and evaluated classification models to help predict sentiment polarity (negative, positive).

Steps involved in the sentiment analysis -
1. Exploring data
2. Three dictionaries are considered, available through the tidytext package – the NRC dictionary of terms denoting different sentiments,      the extended sentiment lexicon developed by Prof Bing Liu, and the AFINN dictionary which includes words commonly used in user-generated    content in the web.
3. Develop models to predict review sentiment.
